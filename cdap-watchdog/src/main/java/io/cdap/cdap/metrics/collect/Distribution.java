     * Trying to minimize memory usage for the buckets. Using a long[64] will always store 64 numbers,
     * most of them being 0. A HashMap is an alternative, but boxing overhed is high (roughly 10X) for
     * each long.
     *
     * A third alternative used is to increase array size till the highest bucket. But this involves
     * repeatedly copying the array.
     *
     * The current approach strikes a balance by using an array of arrays. Ex. bucket 52 is stored in
     * the 6th row, 5th column (6*8 + 5th column). Initially all rows are null. The moment a bucket increases
     * by 1, a long[8] is created for that row. When bucket 52 becomes non-zero, the 6th row is initialized to
     * long[8] and the 5th column is increased to 1. If bucket 53 needs to be incremented, the row already
     * exists. So the 6th column is incremented.
     *
     * In the worst case, this can take storage for 64 longs + 8 row references. But in the normal case, the range
     * of values for a metric will probably within a 256X range i.e. max value <= min * 256. So at most two rows
     * will have to be initialized, resulting in 8*2 long number storage + 8 object references.
